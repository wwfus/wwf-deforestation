      <h1>Disease and Deforestation</h1>
      <p>
        Approximately half of todayâ€™s infectious diseases are zoonotic in
        origin &mdash; meaning they transmit to humans from other animals &mdash; including
        COVID-19, Ebola, malaria, and Lyme disease. As outbreaks and pandemics
        threaten global health and economies, scientists are looking at the
        origins of zoonotic disease and why these spillovers from animals to
        humans are on the rise. Emerging research shows that land use, and
        specifically deforestation, can increase the risk and spread of
        infectious diseases. Forest loss and fragmentation lead to greater
        concentrations of disease pathogens and more frequent interactions
        between animal hosts, vectors, and humans.
