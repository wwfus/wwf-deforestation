        <h2>Malaria and the Amazon</h2>
        <p>
          Malaria affected 228 million people globally in 2018 and resulted in
          an estimated 405,000 associated deaths. Research shows that
          deforestation is linked to increases in malaria across different
          regions and different species of mosquitoes. Malaria is one of the
          infectious diseases with the most research on its ties to
          deforestation and may offer scientists insights into other zoonotic
          diseases.

        <h3>Region Disease Profile</h3>
        <p>
          A 13-year study of 795 municipalities in the Amazon found a 10%
          increase in deforestation led to a 3.3% increase in rates of malaria.
          The early stages of deforestation – as forest edges shift and change –
          showed the greatest impact on malaria outbreaks. Studies noted that
          regional ecological variables, different mosquito species, and
          environmental variables will affect mosquitoes’ ability to develop and
          transmit the malaria parasite.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Deforestation is linked to malaria through increases in sunlight and
            standing water that provide favorable breeding sites for mosquitos,
            as well as the loss of biodiversity and increases in human exposure
            to infected mosquitos.
          </li>
          <li>
            Studies reveal that while some vector mosquitoes require deep forest
            shade, other mosquitoes require partial shade and can thrive on
            forest edges or in areas with reduced tree cover.

          Protecting and conserving the Amazon – a region two-thirds the size of

          40 years and is at the forefront of efforts to protect its forests and
          help its communities. We engage local communities and partner with
          governments to identify solutions that bridge the need for sustainable
