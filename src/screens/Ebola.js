        <h2>Ebola and West Africa</h2>
        <p>
          Ebola is a rare but severe and often fatal disease, with a mortality
          rate of 50%. The virus is zoonotic in origin, and fruit bats are the
          most probable natural host. Transmission likely occurs from wildlife
          (fruit bats, porcupines, or nonhuman primates) to humans and then
          spreads among people. Recent research also indicates that humans can
          now act as intermediate hosts and can serve as long-term Ebola virus
          reservoirs that trigger new outbreaks.

        <h3>Region Disease Profile</h3>
        <p>
          Studies of Ebola outbreak sites in West and Central Africa demonstrate
          links between forest loss or disturbance and the spread of the virus.
          Researchers found that most cases of Ebola transmission to humans – or
          “spillovers” – occurred in areas where there was the greatest forest
          disturbance which leads to increased contact between people and
          wildlife. Forest loss was found to be the greatest risk factor for
          Ebola, more than high human population density or other favorable
          viral conditions.

            Since its identification in 1976, Ebola has killed more than 13,000
            people, with all cases originating in Africa. The outbreak in West
            and Central Africa between 2014 and 2016 was the most severe, with
            more cases and deaths than all other outbreaks combined.

        <h3>What WWF is Doing</h3>
        <p>
          Conserving the Congo Basin is a massive effort, requiring
          collaboration on many levels, from local communities to multinational
          partnerships. WWF works to ensure better conservation of natural
          resources and more sustainable methods for their extraction to
          minimize impacts on forests. We also help communities reduce pressure
          for fuelwood by providing alternative fuel sources to timber and
          charcoal. By developing alternative, more sustainable livelihood
          opportunities, we support communities as stewards of their forests and
          their resources.
